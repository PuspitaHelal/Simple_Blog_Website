      <p>Nintendo finally announced that preorders would start on April 24th and that the price would still start at $449.99 in the US. Accessories got price hikes. Preorders started earlier this month in some other territories, including the UK.</p>
      <p>Preorder problems follow Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa issuing a supply warning in Japan on Wednesday. Nintendo also announced this week that invitations to its direct sales in the US might not be available to everyone ahead of launch.</p>
